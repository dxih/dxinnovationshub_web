DXIH — Digital Incubation Hub Landing Page
A high-performance, modern landing page for DXIH, built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI. This project focuses on a "less is more" aesthetic, featuring single-line typography, professional animations, and a responsive incubation-to-execution workflow.

One-Time Scroll Animations: Smooth "Fade-In-Up" entrance animations triggered by the Intersection Observer API.

Interactive UI: Glassmorphism navbar, hover-responsive service cards, and a refined "Get Started" choice stack.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for all screen sizes with single-line text logic to prevent awkward wrapping.

Type Safety: Built with TypeScript for robust development and fewer runtime errors.
